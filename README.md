# glTF-Chronovore-EXT

This started off because I basically wanted to exert more control over materials in the [glTF Blender addon](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Blender-IO).
While I am much too insignificant to even bother requesting a prefix, I still wanted to properly document the format of the schemas should people want to implement them.

Prefix: `CHRONOVORE_` (unapproved, unreserved as of 2024/02/05)

- CHRONOVORE_material_attributes

## CHRONOVORE_material_attributes
