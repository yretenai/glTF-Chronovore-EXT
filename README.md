# glTF-Legiayayana-EXT

This started off because I basically wanted to exert more control over materials in the [glTF Blender addon](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Blender-IO).
While I am much too insignificant to even bother requesting a prefix, I still wanted to properly document the format of the schemas should people want to implement them.

Prefix: `LEGIAYAYANA_` (unapproved, unreserved as of 2022/09/08)

- LEGIAYAYANA_complex_packed_brdf_material
- LEGIAYAYANA_nodegraph_material
